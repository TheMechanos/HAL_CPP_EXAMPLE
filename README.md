# STM32F411CC Project with HAL and C++

## Description

This project serves as an example of using C++ in conjunction with the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the STM32F411CC microcontroller. The aim of this project is to showcase a practical approach to programming STM32 microcontrollers using advanced C++ techniques.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:
- STM32CubeIDE.
- STM32F411CC microcontroller.
- Basic knowledge of microcontroller programming and C++.

## Instructions

1. Clone this project to your local environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheMechanos/HAL_CPP_EXAMPLE.git
```
2.  Open the project in your preferred IDE.
    
3.  Configure the project according to the requirements of your STM32F411CC microcontroller.
    
4.  Build the project and flash it onto your microcontroller.
    
5.  Run the project on your microcontroller and observe its behavior.
